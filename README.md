# Advent of Code 2022

This is my attempt at the [2022 edition of the annual event](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

To run a day:

```
go run main.go <day-number>
```

To run tests:

```
make test
```

Or to run for just one day run:

```
go test -v ./day-<number>
```

To build and run:
```
make clean
make
./aoc <day-number>
```
